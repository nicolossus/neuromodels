    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NEST (nestsimulator.org; Gewaltig and Diesmann, 2007). is a simulation software for spiking neural networks. The focus of NEST is on the dynamics of large neuronal networks with complex connectivity, rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons. Thus, NEST simulates neural networks of point neurons, i.e., neuron models that collapse the morphology of dendrites, axons, and somata into either a single compartment or a small number of compartments. \n",
    "\n",
    "A NEST simulation consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Nodes__ are all neurons, devices, and also sub-networks. Nodes have a dynamic state that changes over time and that can be influenced by incoming _events_.\n",
    "* __Events__ are pieces of information of a particular type. The most common event is the spike-event. Other event types are voltage events and current events.\n",
    "* __Connections__ are communication channels between nodes. Only if one node is connected to another node, can they exchange events. Connections are weighted, directed, and specific to one event type. Directed means that events can flow only in one direction. The node that sends the event is called _source_ and the node that receives the event is called _target_. The weight determines how strongly an event will influence the target node. A second parameter, the _delay_, determines how long an event needs to travel from source to target.\n",

    "### The Brunel Network Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brunel network model (Brunel, 2000) is composed of $N$ integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons, from which $N_E$ are excitatory and $N_I$ inhibitory, interconnected with current-based synapses. Each \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron receives ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The local cortical network consists of two neuron populations: a population of $N_E$ excitatory neurons and a population of $N_I$ inhibitory neurons. To mimic the cortical ratio of 80% excitatory neurons and 20% inhibitory neurons, we assume that $N_E=$ 8000 and $N_I=$ 2000. Thus, our local network has a total of 10,000 neurons.\n",
    "For both the excitatory and the inhibitory population, we use the same integrate-and-fire neuron model with current-based synapses. Incoming excitatory and inhibitory spikes displace the membrane potential $V_m$ by $J_{E}$ and $J_I$, respectively. If $V_m$ reaches the threshold value $V_{\\text{th}}$, the membrane potential is reset to $V_{\\text{reset}}$, a spike is sent with delay $D=$ 1.5 ms to all post-synaptic neurons, and the neuron remains refractory for $\\tau_{\\text{rp}}=$ 2.0 ms.\n",

    "**Figure:** Sketch of the network model proposed by Brunel (2000). The network consists of three populations: NE excitatory neurons (circle labeled E), NI inhibitory neurons (circle labeled I), and a population of identical, independent Poisson processes (PGs) representing activity from outside the network. Arrows represent connections between the network nodes. Triangular arrow-heads represent excitatory and round arrow-heads represent inhibitory connections. The numbers at the start and end of each arrow indicate the multiplicity of the connection."
